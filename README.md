# Institution-App
<h1>Problem:</h1> Accommodating all student services at a place is difficult. Information is spread out on multiple websites. Right now, there is no application dedicated to students in the university.
<h1>Solution:</h1> We built an android app that contains basic details about the student. Such as, attendance, day-to-day schedule, important documents. This app also enables the users to upload documents, if any required. 

Functionality and Concepts: 
Some of the functionalities and concepts used are:
To get Splash Screen we used animation
Image extraction
Visual transformation
Navigation
Created textfields, buttons, card layout 
Future Scope: 
We plan on connecting the app to a database to improve its function and add a chat box so that the students can resolve their queries.
We also plan on developing a similar app for the faculty, so that students and faculty can interact with each other
